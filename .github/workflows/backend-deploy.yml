# Notes:
# - You can set up deployment either with a Service Principal (AZURE_CREDENTIALS) or with a publish profile (FUNCTIONS_PUBLISH_PROFILE). Configure one of them as a repo secret.
# - Obtain a publish profile from the Azure Portal (Function App -> Get publish profile) and add it to repo secrets.
# - Set AZURE_FUNCTION_APP_NAME as a repo secret with the name of your Function App.
